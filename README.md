## 🚀 Current Endeavors
- Spearheading a stealth **startup** in personalized medicine for neurodegenerative disorders, backed by JHU, On Deck, and Kleiner Perkins.
- Garnered over $500k in non-dilutive funding for the development of patent-pending thermoelectric generators and boost converters.
- Devised hydrogels with neural stem cells for stroke patients, currently in vitro.
- Co-invented a handheld fluorescence imaging device for breast cancer detection with 95% accuracy.
- Leading programs that support 500+ students in science Olympiad/food science with 100+ mentors (5,000+ volunteer hours annually).

## 💼 Startups
I'm a part of [ThermoBeat](http://www.thermobeat.com), where we're building thermoelectric generators, boost converters, and AI to power the future of medical devices and diagnostics.

## 🧪 Research
My research is focused on drug delivery using hydrogels implanted with neural stem cells and LAG3 characterization for Parkinson’s. With previous research experience spanning epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, breast cancer, and infectious diseases, I've presented my work at esteemed platforms like Nature, Harvard, and more.

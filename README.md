👋 Hello, I'm Will, a Senior at Johns Hopkins University, originally from Toronto, Canada. I am passionate about biomedical engineering, thermoelectrics, drug delivery, and the democratization of science education.

## 🚀 Current Endeavors
- Spearheading a stealth startup in personalized medicine for neurodegenerative disorders, backed by JHU, On Deck, and Kleiner Perkins.
- Raised over $500k in non-dilutive funding to build patent-pending thermoelectric generators and boost converters.
- Pioneered the development of hydrogels with neural stem cells for stroke patients, currently in vitro.
- Co-invented a handheld fluorescence imaging device for breast cancer detection with 95% accuracy.
- Leading programs that support 500+ students in science Olympiad/food science with 100+ mentors (5,000+ volunteer hours annually).

## 💼 Startups
[ThermoBeat](http://www.thermobeat.com): Building thermoelectric generators, boost converters, and AI to power the future of medical devices and diagnostics.

## 🧪 Research
Focusing on drug delivery using hydrogels implanted with neural stem cells and LAG3 characterization for Parkinson’s. I have previous research experience in 5 labs spanning epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, breast cancer, and infectious diseases. You can check out my research [here](https://willjblair.com/portfolio).

## 📚 Education 
Committed to ensuring equal access and opportunity in science for all youth. Co-founder of Seedling Hydroponics and President of Charm City Science League. Find out more about these initiatives [here](http://seedlinghydroponic.com) and [here](http://bit.ly/3InhW4u).

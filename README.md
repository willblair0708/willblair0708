## What I'm doing 🚀
- Building a stealth startup in personalized medicine for neurodegenerative disorders with backing from JHU, On Deck, and Kleiner Perkins.
- Raised over $500k in non-dilutive funding to build patent-pending thermoelectric generators and boost converters.
- Developed hydrogels with neural stem cells for stroke patients, currently in vitro.
- Co-built a hand-held fluorescence imaging device for breast cancer with 95% accuracy.
- Lead programs supporting 500+ students in science Olympiad/food science with 100+ mentors (5,000+ volunteer hours per year).

## 🚀 Current Endeavors

- Building a stealth startup in **personalized medicine** for neurodegenerative disorders, with backing from JHU, On Deck, and Kleiner Perkins.
- Raised $500k+ in non-dilutive funding to develop patent-pending **thermoelectric generators and boost converters**.
- Developing **hydrogels with neural stem cells** for stroke patients, currently in vitro.
- Co-built a handheld **fluorescence imaging device for breast cancer** with 95% accuracy.
- Leading programs supporting 500+ students in science Olympiad/food science with 100+ mentors (5,000+ volunteer hours per year).

## 💼 Startups

Involved in [ThermoBeat](http://www.thermobeat.com), where we are building thermoelectric generators, boost converters, and AI for the future of medical devices and diagnostics.

## 🧪 Research

My research primarily involves drug delivery using hydrogels implanted with neural stem cells and LAG3 characterization for Parkinson’s. I have also conducted research in five labs spanning epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, breast cancer, and infectious diseases. You can find more about my research [here](https://willjblair.com/portfolio).

## 📚 Education 

As the co-founder of Seedling Hydroponics and President of Charm City Science League, I am committed to promoting equal access and opportunity in science for all youth. Learn more about these initiatives [here](http://seedlinghydroponic.com) and [here](http://bit.ly/3InhW4u).

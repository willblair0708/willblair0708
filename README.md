## 🚀 Current Endeavors
> "Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity, and is the torch which illuminates the world." - Louis Pasteur

I'm currently:

- 🔬 Pioneering a stealth startup in **personalized medicine** for neurodegenerative disorders, backed by prestigious institutions like JHU, On Deck, and Kleiner Perkins.
- 💰 Raising funds and developing patent-pending **thermoelectric generators and boost converters**.
- 🧫 Working on **hydrogels with neural stem cells** for stroke patients, currently in the in vitro stage.
- 🌈 Co-developing a handheld **fluorescence imaging device for breast cancer** detection with a stunning 95% accuracy.
- 📚 Leading science education programs supporting hundreds of students with the help of dedicated mentors.

## 💼 Startups
> "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower." - Steve Jobs

I'm making waves in the startup world:

| Name | Description | Role |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- |
| [ThermoBeat](http://www.thermobeat.com) | We're revolutionizing the medical devices and diagnostics industry with our thermoelectric generators, boost converters, and AI. | Co-Founder, CTO |

## 🧪 Research
> "Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody else has thought." - Albert Szent-Gyorgyi

My research primarily revolves around drug delivery using hydrogels implanted with neural stem cells and LAG3 characterization for Parkinson’s. I have also ventured into various fields spanning epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, breast cancer, and infectious diseases. Dive into my research [here](https://willjblair.com/portfolio).

## 📚 Education 
> "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." - Nelson Mandela

As the co-founder of Seedling Hydroponics and President of Charm City Science League, I'm devoted to promoting equal access and opportunity in science for all youth. Learn more about these initiatives [here](http://seedlinghydroponic.com) and [here](http://bit.ly/3InhW4u).

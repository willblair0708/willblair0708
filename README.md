<summary>🧪 Research</summary>

> "Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody else has thought." - Albert Szent-Gyorgyi

My research primarily involves drug delivery using hydrogels implanted with neural stem cells and LAG3 characterization for Parkinson’s. I have also conducted research in five labs spanning epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, breast cancer, and infectious diseases. You can find more about my research [here](https://willjblair.com/portfolio).
